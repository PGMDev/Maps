Maps
====

The maps provided in this folder are "classic" maps that were developed during the early days of PGM. 
They are provided with the *sole* purpose of loading sample maps for your server if you have not added a Git repository or a folder with valid maps. 
This is **not** an exhaustive list of maps and only severe bug fixes will be accepted, with no additions or further changes.

Moreover, the maps and their associated files are **not** included under the license used by PGM (https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM/blob/dev/LICENSE). 
Therefore, all rights are reserved by the authors of each of these maps. 
Authors who wish to revoke their map may open an issue at https://github.com/PGMDev/Maps/issues and their request will be fulfilled.
